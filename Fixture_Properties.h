// Fixture_Properties.h

// This should be the only file you need to change when installing the chip into a new fixture.

// I'm thinking there are several ways to define a fixture and it's properties:
// 1: 100% manually by defining all neccessary variables.
// 2: 50% manually by using preset configurations.
// 3: 0% manually by parsing a fixture_ID into all relevant parameters.
